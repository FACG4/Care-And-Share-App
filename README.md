## Problem Statment:
The problem is located in three points:

 * Lack of support for carers.
 * Giving carers a way to connect and support each other.
 * Digitize the "My Book" book.

#### Our solution:
Creating CAS(Care And Share) App to Improve Information sharing within the carers network
and find a place where allows the carers to communicate to each other.

## user Stories:

- carers can sign up and login.
- carers can browse and search other 'anonymised' carers.
- carers can request to connect.
- carers can see requests and accept.
- carers can see who they have connected with.
- carers can send messages to their connections.
